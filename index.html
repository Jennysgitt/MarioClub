    <h2>It's Me, Mario!</h2>
    <h3>Hello,everyone! It's me, Mario!I’m a brave and cheerful plumber from the Mushroom Kingdom, always ready to save Princess Peach from the tricky Bowser!
        With my red cap, blue overalls, and iconic mustache,I jump, run, and stomp Goombas to keep the kingdom safe. My brother,
        Luigi, is taller and a little nervous,but he’s always by my side for adventures!
        I love eating Super Mushrooms to grow big and Fire Flowers to throw fireballs. 
        Yoshi, my trusty dinosaur friend, helps me travel across dangerous lands,
        and Toad is always there with helpful advice. Princess Peach is kind and smart—she’s the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom and a great friend!
    </h3>
